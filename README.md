The multivendor e-commerce platform is designed to facilitate online buying and selling, similar to platforms like Daraz.com. The project is structured into three main user roles: Admin, Seller, and Buyer.

Admin:
The admin(s) have the authority to manage and oversee the platform's operations. They monitor seller activities, approve seller accounts, and manage product categories. Sellers must provide necessary details to create an account, which is then reviewed and activated by the admin. Admins have control over which product categories are allowed on the platform. There can be multiple admins if the platform is managed by more than one person (e.g., co-owners or partners).

Seller:
Sellers can upload products with pricing and images under the appropriate categories. They have access to a dashboard to track their business performance, monitor sales, and communicate with buyers. Sellers are notified when a buyer initiates a purchase and can track payment status. They can communicate directly with buyers, but they are the only ones who can contact admins.

Buyer:
Buyers can browse products, make purchases, and communicate directly with sellers regarding their orders. Buyers do not have direct communication with admins; all queries are handled through sellers.

The multivendor e-commerce platform is designed to facilitate online buying and selling, similar to platforms like Daraz.com. The project is structured into three main user roles: Admin, Seller, and Buyer.
1.	Admin:
o	The admin(s) have the authority to manage and oversee the platform's operations. They monitor seller activities, approve seller accounts, and manage product categories.
o	Sellers must provide necessary details to create an account, which is then reviewed and activated by the admin.
o	Admins have control over which product categories are allowed on the platform.
o	There can be multiple admins if the platform is managed by more than one person (e.g., co-owners or partners).
2.	Seller:
o	Sellers can upload products with pricing and images under the appropriate categories.
o	They have access to a dashboard to track their business performance, monitor sales, and communicate with buyers.
o	Sellers are notified when a buyer initiates a purchase and can track payment status.
o	They can communicate directly with buyers, but they are the only ones who can contact admins.
3.	Buyer:
o	Buyers can browse products, make purchases, and communicate directly with sellers regarding their orders.
o	Buyers do not have direct communication with admins; all queries are handled through sellers.
